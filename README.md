# CSE-15
Discrete Mathematics with Python &amp; LaTeX
This course covers the basic concepts of discrete mathematics used in computer
science and other disciplines that involve formal reasoning. The topics include
logic, proof, counting, discrete probability, relations, graphs, trees, and Boolean
algebra.

This course will cover five major themes: <br />
1. Mathematical reasoning: Student will learn to read, comprehend and construct
mathematical arguments. As a first step in this process, students will learn
mathematical logic and proof techniques.<br />
2. Combinatorial Analysis: Students will learn to perform combinatorial analysis
to solve counting problems and analyze algorithms.<br />
3. Discrete Structures: Students will learn several abstract mathematical structures
used to represent discrete objects and their relationships, which include sets,
permutations, relations, graphs, and trees.<br />
4. Algorithmic Thinking: Students will learn to specify an algorithm, verify that it
works properly, and the analyze its performance based on computer memory and
time requirements.<br />
5. Applications: Students will learn about the applications of discrete mathematics
to computer science and data networking, and other areas, like chemistry,
biology, linguistics, geography, business, and the Internet.<br />
