CSE 015: Discrete Mathematics Homework 1

Spring 2021

**Introduction**

This assignment will give you practice in translating English sentences into propositional logic, also known as knowledge representation. You will also be practicing your LATEX skills

**Exercises**

Create a new LATEX document and type out the solutions to the following exercises. Your document should include an appropriate title, your name, as well as a date. Please number your solutions appropriately.

Upload your .tex and your .pdf files under the relevant CatCourses assignment.

Represent the following sentences in propositional logic. State the meaning of all propositional variables you have chosen, and use the logical connectives appropriately.

**Example** Translate the sencence “The sun is hot and the ocean is wet” into propositional logic. **Solution** Let *p* = The sun is hot, and let *q* = The ocean is wet, then *p* ∧ *q*

**Knowledge Representation**

1. It is not cloudy and it is not raining.
1. I like to eat apples and bananas.
1. Behind the clouds the sun is shining.
1. If a function is differentiable then the function is continuous.
1. I will study for the final otherwise I will fail.

**Equivalence in Propositional Logic**

Determine whether the following pairs of propositions are equivalent to each other. If they are not equivalent, explain why. If they are equivalent, provide a proof.

1. *p* ∧ *q* and *p* ∨ ¬*q*
1. *p* ∨ *q* and ¬*p* ∨ ¬*q*
1. *p* → *q* and ¬*q* → ¬*p*
1. *p* → *q* and ¬*p* ∨ *q*
1. ¬(*p* ∧ *q*) and ¬*p* ∨ ¬*q*
